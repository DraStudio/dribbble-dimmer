Dribbble Dimmer is a simple Chrome extension that enables the viewing of the shots on Dribbble.com over a dimmed background. It provides a subtle icon in the corner of the large view and dims the background on mouse hover.

Based on an original project placed on GitHub by Jason Long.

You can add this to Chrome via the included .crx file or by enabling "Developer Mode" in Chrome and packing it yourself.
